### What Container?
> https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code 
and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably 
from one computing environment to another. 
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software 
that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, 
system libraries and settings.
